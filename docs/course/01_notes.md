# Chapter 01 - Environment Setup

## Introduction

Now that we have covered the high-level design of the application, we are ready to set up our local development environment and start creating our TigerGraph Fullstack App.

In this tutorial, we will use macOS. However, nearly every code section has Windows equivalents and Linux equivalents. For Windows reference, check out [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)!

## Trusted Resources

Before beginning, it‚Äôs important to choose reliable sources to learn from. Just like it's important to get your news from reputable sources, it's important to get your technical information from tried and trusted sources. Here are some of our personal favorites:

## Tools

???+ tip "The HTML/CSS/JS"

    For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, [Mozilla's MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is our go-to. We literally have it open all the time üòÖ.It's a good idea to head directly to [MDN‚Äôs GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straight to the source. In this case, we will be using framework libraries like ReactJS and Antv G6.

???+ tip "The Browser"

    Our recommendation is Chrome. The extension tools are amazing and the team behind them are amazing too. We will use the JSON Formatter extension as well.It can be installed via the following [hyperlink](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en).

???+ tip "The Editor"

    Our recommendation is Visual Studio Code. It's free, open-source, and works well on Mac, Linux, and Windows. Perhaps one of the best features of VSCode is it has a huge amount of [available plugins](https://aka.ms/vscode-marketplace) to choose from. Feel free to take a look!

    If you're not feeling VSCode, two other editors that are similar in their offering are [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/). Both are great tools! Both are free to download. However, Sublime requires a subscription basis of $65 in order to gain business licenses.

    If you want a more complete offering, you may investigate using an integrated development environment (commonly called an IDE.) The reigning, best IDE for front-end development is [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). WebStorm is a very powerful IDE that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an editor; it aims to be the entire development suite. Great tool!

???+ tip "The Terminal"

    You will have to use a terminal, but it‚Äôs less scary than it seems, we promise! For the shell, we are going to use [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). You don't need to install it unless you're using Windows (then use [these steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to enable it). It's 99% already there on your computer unless you're using some obscure flavor of Linux. Whenever you open your Mac terminal, it'll be running bash by default unless it has been changed. To remedy any command, check out this [hyperlink!](https://explainshell.com/)

    However, there are other options as well. The reason we use bash is that it is so prevalent. Bash is everywhere. Everything you Google will have the answers written in bash. Other shell people swear by is [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/). All very cool but we  recommend looking at them later.

???+ tip "Node.js"

    Node.js is a runtime built on top of Chrome's V8. It allows you to develop apps in JavaScript outside of the browser. It's single-threaded non-blocking and asynchronous. This is achieved by the use of an event loop at the core of Node.js. If you know JS then you already know how to develop with Node.js! Let‚Äôs take a closer look...

    **For Windows**

    If you're running Windows and not using Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL), I recommend you use the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/) from the Node.js site. Make sure to choose the latest LTS version.

    **For Non-Windows**

    If you're not on Windows or you are using WSL, we recommend installing Node.js with [NVM (node version manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). NVM allows you to install many versions of Node.js at once and switch whenever you may need to. Additionally, NVM installs Node.js in a folder that will not have permission errors that you would otherwise run into with the official installer. Once you have nvm installed, you need to install a Node version. You can download the latest LTS version with this command.

    ```
    nvm install --lts
    ```

## Frontend

With the tool installed, we are now ready to <font color='#DD6E0F'>create a quasar project</font> folder! First, it‚Äôs good practice to create a bigger scope project folder named `tigergraph_fullstack`.

```
mkdir tigergraph_fullstack
cd tigergraph_fullstack
```

Next, we create a React project with npx:

```
npx create-react-app front
```

After the create React project command, you should see the terminal prints:

{++We suggest that you begin by typing:++}

{++cd front++}

{++yarn start++}

{++Happy hacking!++}

Now, we can open our `tigergraph_fullstack` project with vscode and open the terminal inside vscode as well. This can be done with a shortcut: ctrl + \` (for windows) or cmd + \` (for mac)

&nbsp; &nbsp;

Without further ado, let‚Äôs start our React project!

```
tigergraph_fullstack$ cd front
tigergraph_fullstack$ yarn start

Compiled successfully!

You can now view front in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.50.45:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

With the above lines, we have created our frontend project folder named front, and we have also run the project by using the command ‚Äúyarn start‚Äù inside the project folder (front).

Now, we can use a browser to open the project with URL: http://localhost:3000

&nbsp; &nbsp;

Awesome! Next, we will use some libraries to add to our fullstack app, so let‚Äôs install them inside the quasar project folder (front). To do this, we can run the following.

```
front$ npm i axios
```

```
front$ npm i @antv/g6
```

&nbsp; &nbsp;

Neat! Next up, let‚Äôs examine the middleware, an essential part of our project.

## Middleware

### Python Virtual Environment

To start off, we'll create a python virtual enviroment (venv). A venv is a tool which keeps different dependencies of different projects ioslated. Hence, using this, we won'thave to pip install all of the packages on each new project.

Step I: Create Middleware Directory
Let's create a middleware project directory in parralle to frontend directory

```
tigergraph-fullstack$ mkdir middleware
tigergraph-fullstack$ cd middleware
```

Step II: Create your Virtual Environment
Now using Python, we can create a virtual environment using venv and Python.

```
middleware$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Awesome! Now, this create a folder called "venv" in our directory. We can then activate this virtual environment using:

```
middleware$ source venv/bin/activate
```

After running activate the virtual enviroment, you should see a (venv) in front of your terminal.

Step III: Install Packages
For this project, we‚Äôll be using pyTigerGraph and Fast PI. FastAPI also uses a library called [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), so we‚Äôll install that as well.

```
middleware$ pip install pyTigerGraph fastapi uvicorn
```

Perfect! After running this, we should be ready to go!

### FastAPI

Step I: Create a Basic API
Now, let‚Äôs create our first basic API. First, let‚Äôs create a file called ‚Äúmain.py.‚Äù

```
touch main.py
```

Click into it, and then use the code from the [FastAPI website](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) in that file.

```
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
     return {"Hello": "World"}
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Optional[str] = None):
     return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

Step II: Run the API
Save main.py then run it with the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Here, we‚Äôre using uvicorn to run our file. The filename is main and the --reload has the server automatically reload after we save new changes to the file.

Step III: Explore the Custom Endpoints
Open a browser to the page https://127.0.0.1:8000. There, you‚Äôll find the {‚ÄúHello‚Äù: ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù} from the first function.

Now, let‚Äôs go to https://127.0.0.1:8000/items/1. That will result in {‚Äúitem_id‚Äù:1,‚Äùq‚Äù:null}.

The ‚Äúitem_id‚Äù is the parameter we passed into it (the /1), but we didn‚Äôt pass a q in this case.

Let‚Äôs give q a value by going to https://127.0.0.1:8000/items/1?q=test.

Perfect! Here, we passed the optional parameter q as test for the items endpoint.

Step IV: Explore the Prebuilt Endpoints
Finally, FastAPI has a few prebuilt endpoints, specifically for creating documentation. First, if you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, you‚Äôll find interactive documentation for the endpoints we created.

Not a fan of that style? If you go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc, you‚Äôll find a different style of documentation.

And with that, let‚Äôs now start up the TigerGraph server to integrate pyTigerGraph to our endpoints.
